Brew Wisely &amp; Enjoy Your Fresh Drink<br/>
you: What's this? <br/>
me: Do you like drinking tea & coffee at office? <br/>
you: Is this a question? Go on. <br/>
me: What about times that there is coffee in the coffee maker but you don't know is it fresh? <br/>
you: Yeah, I hate it. I just test it by sipping <br/>
me: Even if you taste, are you gouru enough to know when it has been brewed? <br/>
you: This is getting ridiculous, come back to the project <br/>
me: Ok. You define the drinks(names, brewing times etc) then when you are going to prepare it, you click the button. <br/>
you: And? <br/>
me: You will see, there will be a list about brewing time stamps so you will know exact times of brewing, and you can make the desicion to drink it or not?<br/>
you: Even I can become a gouru by checking the times and tastes as well. <br/>
me: It's up to you, but this is not designed for that you know... <br/>
